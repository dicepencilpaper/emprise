   <h1 id="welcome-to-emprise">Welcome to Emprise!</h1>

   <p>This is a medieval world of fantasy and high stakes! Take your adventurer to dangerous quests into dark caves, mysterious dungeons, mystical towers, and more. It is a world of low technology, warring kingdoms, and dangerous monsters lurking everywhere. Be courageous, be brave, don your armor, and create stories that will be retold for ages!</p>
   <p>This system is designed so that most adventure settings can be adapted to it. Similarly, you can create your own world and lore, and the Emprise system should be able to work quite well with it.</p>

   <h2 id="participants">Participants</h2>

   <p>A session of Emprise is composed of one to four people that will be playing with their <em>adventurers</em>, and one player who is in charge of presenting the situations, scenes, and controlling the rest of the universe&#39;s entities. This player is known as the <em>Coordinator</em>, as they take care of running the game in an orderly fashion and making sure things are fair for everyone.</p>

   <h2 id="components-needed">Components needed</h2>

   <p>To set up and play a game of Emprise, you will need the following:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>Paper for noting the adventurer&#39;s stats and description, and for the Coordinator to take notes. Any type of paper works.</li>
      <li>Pencils or pens for writing. Pencils are recommended.</li>
      <li>At least <em>one full set</em> of polyhedral dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. However, it is ideal if every participant has their own set of dice, as it will make the game run much smoother.</li>
   </ul>

   <p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

   <h1 id="the-adventurer">The adventurer</h1>

   <p>Your adventurer is a daring, courageous individual that is ready to face whatever fate throws at them! An adventurer has one to four <em>professions</em> that define their skills and capabilities. Each one of these abilities gets a dice assigned to it. The lower the die, the better they are at that profession. These determine the adventurer&#39;s skills and capabilities.</p>

   <h2 id="creating-an-adventurer">Creating an adventurer</h2>

   <p>There are four dice available for each adventurer. These dice are: d6, d8, d10, and d12. Unlike most RPGs, the <em>smaller</em> a die is, the <em>better</em> it is, so keep this in mind when assigning your dice. Each die is assigned to your adventurer&#39;s character elements as follows:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>One die for <em><a href="#adventuring-skills">adventuring skills</a></em>. This is obligatory for all adventurers, however, you can assign any die you want to this element.</li>
      <li>One to three dice for <em><a href="#professions">professions</a></em>, or</li>
      <li>One to two dice for professions, and one die for <em><a href="#magic">magic</a></em>.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>You can assign these dice as you wish, however, dice assignments cannot be repeated; for example, you cannot assign a d6 to two different character elements. Each die must be unique to each element.</p>
   <p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

   <h1 id="adventuring-skills">Adventuring skills</h1>

   <p>Every adventurer has, of course, adventuring skills! This covers a practical knowledge set comprised of the following elements:</p>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Fighting:</strong> The adventurer knows how to fight with or without weapons, use armor, and shields. They can also perform maneuvers during combat.</li>
      <li><strong>Traveling:</strong> They will have a decent sense of direction, and know how to travel in different types of terrain. They will also possess basic knowledge of the dangers in each.</li>
      <li><strong>Camping:</strong> The adventurer knows the basics of setting up camp: shelter, fire, and related things.</li>
   </ul>

   <p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

   <h1 id="professions">Professions</h1>

   <p>A profession encompasses a relatively wide skill and knowledge set. Here are a few examples of possible professions:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>Metalsmith</li>
      <li>Merchant</li>
      <li>Thief</li>
      <li>Explorer</li>
      <li>Painter</li>
      <li>Politician</li>
      <li>Soldier</li>
      <li>Musician</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Note that professions do not have detailed, granular skills and abilities; rather, it is expected that everyone uses common sense and creativity when using professions. Does an action performed under a certain profession makes sense to everyone? Then it is valid!</p>
   <p>For example, it is expected that someone with the profession of <em>musician</em> is good at understanding musical instruments, composition, and knowledgeable of music history. But a creative use of this profession could enable them to be really good at persuading people, simply based on their experience as public performers. Be flexible and creative.</p>
   <p>Professions are utilized via <em><a href="#actions">actions</a></em>, explained later in these rules.</p>
   <p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>
   
   <h1 id="actions">Actions</h1>

   <p>Any activity or task that requires knowledge and skill is called an <em>action</em>. This includes using your adventurer&#39;s skills and combat actions such as attacking an enemy. To check if an action is successful or not, you need to roll a single die as needed, from a d4 to a d20,and then consult the following table (thelower the result, the better):</p>

   <table class="center">

      <thead>
         <tr>
            <th>Value rolled</th>
            <th>Result</th>
            <th>Description</th>
         </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Absolute Success</td>
            <td>The adventurer&#39;s action excels and is successful. No <a href="#result-shift">result shifts</a> will affect the result, it is final and unchangeable. Not only do they succeed, they can optionally ask for an additional related effect from their action (to be discussed with the Coordinator as not to imbalance things).</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Critical Success</td>
            <td>The adventurer&#39;s action excels in its success. Same as an absolute success, not only do they succeed, they can ask for an additional related effect. However, this result can be altered by modifiers.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>Success</td>
            <td>The action succeeded as intended by the player. Modifiers can affect the result.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Near failure</td>
            <td>The action succeeded, but barely. A negative side effect of the action can happen at the discretion of the Coordinator. As with a critical success, this effect has to be measured and not imbalance events unnecessarily. As the previous ones, this can be changed by modifiers.</td>
         </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5+</td>
            <td>Failure</td>
            <td>The action fails. Modifiers can affect the result.</td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>

   </table>

   <p><em>Coordinator&#39;s Note: It is recommended that you exercise balance regarding when to roll. Excessive rolls bog down the game; only roll for things that you consider will require a special application of the adventurer&#39;s profession. Be fair, and keep the game flowing. However, tasks that would normally succeed automatically could require a roll if the is trying to perform under stressful or difficult circumstances.</em>
   </p>

   <h2 id="difficulty-modifiers">Difficulty modifiers</h2>

   <p>Not all actions are equal, and some will be harder to perform than others. There are two different types of modifiers for actions.</p>

   <h3>Dice Shift</h3>

   A <em>dice shift (DS)</em> will be set by the Coordinator for the action based on any environmental situations that can affect the <em>chances</em> for a successful execution of a task. Dice shifts can be positive (rolling a higher-numbered die) or negative (rolling a lower-numbered die). Positive dice shifts are detrimental, while negative shifts are beneficial. A dice shift is usually presented as DS (+/-)x, with x being the number of dice value changes. For example, a positive dice shift of 2 is presented as DS+2.</p>

   <table class="center">

      <thead>
         <tr>
            <th>Difficulty</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Dice shift</th>
         </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td>Average</td>
            <td>The action can be performed by anyone with a basic skill level.</td>
            <td>0</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Difficult</td>
            <td>The action is hard to carry out, requiring more skill or knowledge.</td>
            <td>+1</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Brutal</td>
            <td>The action is extremely difficult, requiring a superior skill level.</td>
            <td>+2</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Unattainable</td>
            <td>The action is nearly impossible to achieve for most people.</td>
            <td>+3</td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>

   <p>For example, an adventurer with Adventuring d8 wants to shoot an arrow into a small hall in a wall that is quite a distance away. The Coordinator evaluates the situation and determines it&#39;s a Brutal difficulty (DS +2). Therefore, the player now must roll a d12 to determine if they&#39;re successful in their action.</p>

   <h3>Result Shift</h3>

   <p>Another type of modifier is known as <em>Result Shift (RS).</em> These modifiers are used to alter the <em>result</em> of the action, as opposed to the <em>chances</em> of achieving it. The way these are applied is specified in different sections below, as they are applied due to diverse situations and items. A result shift is usually presented as RS (+/-)x, with x being the number of result shifts. For example, a negative result shift of 2 is presented as RS+2.</p></p>

   <h2 id="performing-actions-without-a-profession">Performing actions without a profession</h2>

   <p>When your adventurer is trying to perform an action for which they have no knowledge, you will have to roll for success using the d20 die, and consult the table above.</p>
   <p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

   <h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>

   <p>In real life, combat consists of multiple actions taking place almost simultaneously. However, this is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve in a tabletop game. Therefore, we will slice time and movement using a system composed of <em>rounds</em> and <em>turns</em>, with the order of events set through <em>initiative</em>.
   </p>

   <h2 id="initiative">Initiative</h2>

   <p>At the start of combat, all players and the Coordinator will roll a die as specified in the following table:</p>

   <table class="center">

      <thead>
         <tr>
            <th>Factor</th>
            <th>Die</th>
         </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td>No armor</td>
            <td>d6</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Leather/padded armor</td>
            <td>d8</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Mail armor</td>
            <td>d10</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Plate armor</td>
            <td>d12</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Heavily encumbered</td>
            <td>DS +1</td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>

   </table>

   <p>If a participant is carrying a lot of weight or a bulky item, they will bump up their die to the next higher value. For example, the player of a fighter wearing leather armor that is carrying a backpack fully stuffed to the top with coins will roll a d10 for their initiative instead of a d8. The Coordinator must be reasonable and fair when determining this.</p>

   <h3 id="enemies-and-monsters">Enemies and monsters</h3>

   <p>The Coordinator will roll initiative for each monster <em>group</em>, although they can choose to roll initiative for each opponent if they wish to (usually if there are only no more than eight monsters overall). For humanoid opponents, use the same table as for adventurers to determine the initiative die. Monsters and beasts will have their own die as determined in their description.</p>

   <h3 id="acting-order">Acting order</h3>

   <p>The acting order for all battle participants is established by the roll results in <em>ascending</em> order. In the case of a tie between adventurers, the players choose who goes first. If the tie is between a player and any of the Coordinator&#39;s group of enemies, the player will go first. The Coordinator must annotate the initiative order for reference.</p>

   <h2 id="rounds--turns">Rounds &amp; turns</h2>

   <p>Once the initiative is set, combat begins! This is the start of the round, which encompasses all the plays by all participants. Each player will perform actions in their turn, as set by the initiative order.</p>

   <h2 id="moving">Moving</h2>

   <p>If able to do so, combat participants can move before <em>or</em> after their attack, and as an action in their <em>riposte</em> (explained below). They can also choose to not move at all. Normally, an adventurer will move within Close range and no more than that unless there is some sort of enhancement (magical, for example). Monsters and creatures will have their own maximum movement range as determined in their description.</p>

   <h2 id="attacking">Attacking</h2>

   <p>To perform an attack, roll the <em>adventuring</em> die, or d20 if it is an entity with no fighting abilities. Attacks will be dice shifted by the target&#39;s armor (whether worn or natural). Other variables such as partial cover, environmental obstacles like fog, and other elements like magical protection will add up +1 DS.</p>

   <h3 id="riposte">Riposte</h3>

   <p>The target of an attack, if still conscious and capable, can immediately strike back in return even if it is not their turn in terms of initiative. This is called a riposte, and it makes combat more dynamic, dangerous, and unpredictable. The target of a riposte cannot perform a riposte in return.</p>
   <p>Even after playing their riposte, they will still get to play their turn as originally set by initiative, and in the same manner their target will be able to respond back to the attack with their own riposte, if possible.</p>

   <h2 id="combat-effects">Combat effects</h2>

   <p>Based on the final result of a successful attack roll, certain combat effects will be applied to the target.</p>

   <table class="center">

            <td>Miss</td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>

   </table>

   <p>The player controlling the attacker has the option to choose a less harmful effect to be applied to their target. For example, they might have rolled a 1 with a edged weapon, but might instead choose to <em>stun</em> their opponent.</p>
   <p>Every time a combatant is hit by a successful attack, they will add DS +1 to all their actions, up to a maximum dice shift to d20. </p>
   <p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

   <h1 id="weapons-armor--equipment">Weapons, armor, &amp; equipment</h1>

   <p>Your adventurer needs to be equipped for the dangers they will face exploring the unknown! Make sure to give your character gear that matches their professions and style.</p>

   <h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>

   <p>There are three types of weapons: <em>light (L)</em>, <em>medium (M)</em>, and <em>heavy (H)</em>. Medium and heavy weapons provide a negative dice shift that increases the chances of a successful attack against an opponent. Heavy weapons can only be used by those who have a profession that relates to the military or other similar experience, like being a soldier or a knight.</p>

   <table class="center">

      <thead>

   <p>Missile and thrown weapons have another characteristic: <em>range</em>. This indicates the farthest reach for that weapon when it is used. There are five ranges.</p>

   <p>Note that weapons marked as two-handed (2H) cannot be used simultaneously with a shield.</p>

   <h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>

   <p>Your adventurer can wear armor to protect them from physical damage. Similar to weapons, armor is available in light, medium, and heavy types, and only adventurers with a profession that provides extensive combat training can wear heavy armor. Armor protects by applying a positive dice shift to the attacker&#39;s roll.</p>

   <h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>

   <p>In addition to weapons, your adventurer needs some gear that will keep them safe in their travels, as well as keeping them fed and hydrated. This includes items like rations, a waterskin, torches, a lamp, rope, and other items that can help on an adventure. Not having a required item for an action can prevent an adventurer in performing a certain action. Also, in some cases (as judged by the Coordinator), having the correct gear for an action will provide DS -1 to the roll.</p>

   <h1 id="monsters-and-creatures">Monsters &amp; creatures</h1>

   <p>In this fantasy world, strange creatures and monsters can be found lurking anywhere... Yes, even in the basement of the inn you are staying at! Some creatures are friendly, many are neutral, and others are vicious and evil.</p>
   <p>Creatures work quite similarly to adventurers in terms of game mechanics.</p>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Attack (ATT):</strong> Instead of having an <em>adventurer</em> profession to determine their combat prowess, a monster has an <em>attack (A)</em> die. This die can range from d4 (for a truly powerful creature) to d20.</li>
      <li><strong>Attack type (ATP):</strong> The type of attack(s) performed by the creature.</li>
      <li><strong>Number of attacks (#AT):</strong> The number of attacks per action.</li>
      <li><strong>Defense (DEF):</strong> Monsters will have a set <em>defense (D)</em> score determined by a certain DS bonus. For humanoid creatures, this will be determined by armor type, or any natural armor they could have.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Initiative (INI):</strong> The initiative die used by this creature.</li>
      <li><strong>Move (MOV):</strong> The maximum distance the creature can move per combat round, measured as a range.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Powers:</strong> Any power and abilities will have an assigned die. Unlike adventurers, however, dice assignments do not have to be unique, providing more flexibility in monster design. Note that humanoid monsters can have professions just like adventurers.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Here are some examples:</p>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Goblin</strong> - ATT: d10, ATP: weapon, #AT: 1, DEF: Armor, INI: d6, MOV: C.</li>
      <li><strong>Owlbear</strong> - ATT: d6, ATP: claws (slash)/bite (slash), #AT: 3, DEF: 0, INI: d8, MOV: C.</li>
      <li><strong>Pixie</strong> - ATT: d12, ATP: weapon (slash)/power, #AT: 1, DEF: +2DS, INI: d4, MOV: N, Powers: Illusion d6.</li>
   </ul>
